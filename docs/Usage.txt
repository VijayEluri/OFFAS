Usage:
Currently there isn't yet any listening application that uses OFFAS, 
if you want to implement whatever functionality it's up to you.
Linux:
	netcat -lp 234
	Start OFFAS on your Android device (for the time being the application is called wii on your phone)
	set the address (and port) to the listening machine's address
	press connect and wait for the "connected" message to appear.
	
Windows:
	got to debian.org (or your favourite distro's page) and follow installation instructions.
	see above.
	
MacOSX: I have no idea

Other UNIXes: I'm not sure but probably pretty much the same as linux

On a rooted phone:
	requires: debian or just netcat
	install netcat
	open a terminal and start netcat -lp 234
	same as Linux only with 127.0.0.1 as the address
On a rooted phone through usb cable:
	This is a dirty hack, but on the PC start: 
	#adb shell "nc -lp 234"
	or through debian
	#adb shell "WHATEVERT YOU USE TO CHROOT TO DEBIAN + nc -lp 234"
