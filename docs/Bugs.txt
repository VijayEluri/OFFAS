Bugs:
- The Socket implementation is very (very) bad, if the listening side hangs, the app freezes, so avoid closing the listener first
- The Orientation should be done using the new (non deprecated) method
- When disconnecting when not actually connected the app freezes or throws an Exception

To do:
- Use Threading on WiiConnection and handle socket close
