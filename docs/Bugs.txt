Bugs:
- The Socket implementation is very (very) bad, if the listening side hangs, the app freezes, so avoid closing the listener first - solved
- The Orientation should be done using the new (non deprecated) method
- When disconnecting when not actually connected the app freezes or throws an Exception - solved

To do:
- Use Threading on WiiConnection and handle socket close - done
- Make WiiSensors handle remote end close more gracefully
- Add SSL option
- Add output options (timestamp, selectable sensors, writeGenericValues() option etc
- Make a nice menu
- Make a logo
- Change project name from wii to OFFAS
- Make a simple web-page
- Make some implementing applications
