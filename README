description:
A simple android app to take the sensor data, 
encapsulate it to JSON (Javascript tables) 
and send it to a given address.

usage:
install the app on any given Android device
run, specify an address and port and connect

server side:
on the server side you need to have a listening service on the given port (default 234).
in the project's root, under utils there are a few examples to utilize this (https://github.com/yussidivnall/OFFAS/tree/master/utils).
those use gnuplot, with gunplot.py which you can grub here: http://gnuplot-py.sourceforge.net/
OFFAS isn't limited to this, and can be used to do anything you can think of doing with the sensors.
